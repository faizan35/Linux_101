# 6.4. SSH

### SSH (Secure Shell)

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used for securely connecting to remote systems over an unsecured network. It provides strong authentication and encrypted data communications between two computers.

#### Key Features of SSH:

- **Secure Communication**: Encrypts the data exchanged between the client and the server.
- **Authentication**: Supports multiple authentication methods, including passwords and public key authentication.
- **Port Forwarding**: Allows forwarding of network ports over the SSH connection.
- **Remote Command Execution**: Enables the execution of commands on a remote machine.
- **File Transfer**: Securely transfers files using protocols like SCP (Secure Copy) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

### Basic Usage of SSH

#### Connecting to a Remote Server

```
ssh [user@]hostname [options]
```

- **user**: The username on the remote machine. If omitted, the current local username is used.
- **hostname**: The hostname or IP address of the remote machine.
- **options**: Additional options for the SSH command.

**Example:**

```
ssh user@example.com
```

#### Common Options

- `-p port`: Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.
- `-i identity_file`: Specifies the file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.
- `-L local_port:remote_address:remote_port`: Specifies local port forwarding.
- `-R remote_port:local_address:local_port`: Specifies remote port forwarding.
- `-N`: Do not execute a remote command, useful for port forwarding.
- `-T`: Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

**Example:**

```
ssh -p 2222 user@example.com
```

### Key-Based Authentication

Key-based authentication uses a pair of cryptographic keys (private and public keys) to authenticate users instead of passwords.

#### Generating SSH Keys

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- `-t rsa`: Specifies the type of key to create (RSA in this case).
- `-b 4096`: Specifies the number of bits in the key (4096 bits).
- `-C "your_email@example.com"`: Adds a label/comment to the key.

This command generates two files:

- **id_rsa**: The private key.
- **id_rsa.pub**: The public key.

#### Copying the Public Key to the Remote Server

```
ssh-copy-id user@hostname
```

or manually add the contents of `id_rsa.pub` to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server.

### SSH Configuration File

You can simplify SSH connections using the SSH configuration file `~/.ssh/config`.

**Example:**

```
Host example
    HostName example.com
    User user
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This allows you to connect with:

```
ssh example
```

### SSH Port Forwarding

#### Local Port Forwarding

Forwards a port from the local machine to the remote machine.

```
ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port user@hostname
```

**Example:**

```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:80 user@example.com
```

Accessing `localhost:8080` on your local machine will forward traffic to `localhost:80` on the remote machine.

#### Remote Port Forwarding

Forwards a port from the remote machine to the local machine.

```
ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port user@hostname
```

**Example:**

```
ssh -R 9090:localhost:3000 user@example.com
```

Accessing `localhost:9090` on the remote machine will forward traffic to `localhost:3000` on your local machine.

### SSH File Transfer

#### SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)

Copies files between hosts on a network.

```
scp [options] source destination
```

**Example:**

```
scp file.txt user@example.com:/path/to/destination
scp user@example.com:/path/to/source/file.txt /local/destination
```

#### SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

Provides a secure file transfer capability.

```
sftp user@hostname
```

**Example:**

```
sftp user@example.com
sftp> put localfile.txt /path/to/remote/destination
sftp> get /path/to/remote/source/file.txt localdestination
```

### Common SSH Commands

- **Execute a Command on a Remote Server**:

  ```
  ssh user@example.com 'command'
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```
  ssh user@example.com 'ls -l /var/www'
  ```

- **SSH Agent**:
  Manages private keys and performs authentication without the need to enter the passphrase each time.
  ```
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
  ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

### SSH Security Practices

1. **Disable Root Login**:
   Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

   ```
   PermitRootLogin no
   ```

2. **Change Default SSH Port**:
   Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

   ```
   Port 2222
   ```

3. **Use SSH Key Authentication**:
   Disable password authentication in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

   ```
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ```

4. **Restrict Access**:
   Limit users who can log in via SSH in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

   ```
   AllowUsers user1 user2
   ```

5. **Use Fail2Ban**:
   Install and configure Fail2Ban to protect against brute-force attacks.

### Summary

SSH is a versatile and secure protocol for remote system administration, file transfer, and port forwarding. By understanding and using its various features, you can ensure secure and efficient management of remote systems. Proper configuration and security practices are essential to maintaining the integrity and security of SSH connections.
