# 8.4. User Security

### User Security: `sudo`, Managing Sudoers, and the Principle of Least Privilege

#### `sudo`

`sudo` (superuser do) is a command-line utility that allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. It is a key tool in managing administrative privileges and enforcing the principle of least privilege.

##### Basic Usage

- **Execute a command as root**:

  ```sh
  sudo <command>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

- **Execute a command as another user**:

  ```sh
  sudo -u <username> <command>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo -u postgres psql
  ```

- **Switch to the root user**:
  ```sh
  sudo -i
  ```

#### Managing Sudoers

The sudoers file (`/etc/sudoers`) defines the policies applied to the `sudo` command. Editing this file directly can lead to syntax errors, so it is recommended to use the `visudo` command, which checks for syntax errors before saving.

##### Using `visudo`

- **Open the sudoers file**:
  ```sh
  sudo visudo
  ```

##### Sudoers File Syntax

- **Granting a user sudo privileges**:

  ```sh
  username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  john ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

- **Granting a user specific command privileges**:

  ```sh
  username ALL=(ALL) /path/to/command
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  john ALL=(ALL) /usr/sbin/service
  ```

- **Allow a group to use sudo**:

  ```sh
  %groupname ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  %admin ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

- **Nopasswd option** (allowing a user to run commands without being prompted for a password):
  ```sh
  username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
  ```
  **Example**:
  ```sh
  deployer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl
  ```

#### The Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege dictates that users should have the minimum level of access—or privileges—necessary to perform their job functions. This minimizes the potential damage from accidents or malicious actions.

##### Implementing Least Privilege with `sudo`

1. **Grant Specific Privileges**:
   Instead of granting all users full sudo access, only allow specific commands:

   ```sh
   alice ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/apt-get update, /usr/bin/apt-get upgrade
   ```

2. **Use Groups**:
   Define groups for different privilege levels and assign users to these groups:

   ```sh
   %devops ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/docker
   ```

3. **Restrict Passwordless Access**:
   Only allow passwordless access for the least sensitive commands:

   ```sh
   deployer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx
   ```

4. **Regularly Review Sudoers File**:
   Periodically audit the sudoers file to ensure that users have the appropriate level of access.

5. **Use Aliases**:
   Create command and user aliases to simplify and manage sudoers configurations:
   ```sh
   User_Alias ADMINS = alice, bob
   Cmnd_Alias SERVICES = /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/service
   ADMINS ALL=(ALL) SERVICES
   ```

#### Example Sudoers Configuration

Here’s an example of a sudoers configuration implementing the principle of least privilege:

```sh
# User alias specification
User_Alias  ADMINS = alice, bob
User_Alias  DEVS = charlie, dave

# Cmnd alias specification
Cmnd_Alias  NETWORK = /usr/bin/ifconfig, /usr/bin/netstat
Cmnd_Alias  SERVICES = /usr/bin/systemctl, /usr/bin/service
Cmnd_Alias  PACKAGE = /usr/bin/apt-get, /usr/bin/yum

# Allow ADMINS to execute network and services commands
ADMINS ALL=(ALL) NETWORK, SERVICES

# Allow DEVS to execute package management commands with no password
DEVS ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: PACKAGE

# Allow deployer to restart nginx without a password
deployer ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl restart nginx
```

#### Summary of Key Commands and Concepts

| Command                               | Purpose                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `sudo <command>`                      | Execute a command as root                        |
| `sudo -u <username> <command>`        | Execute a command as another user                |
| `sudo -i`                             | Switch to the root user                          |
| `sudo visudo`                         | Safely edit the sudoers file                     |
| `username ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`          | Grant full sudo privileges to a user             |
| `username ALL=(ALL) /path/to/command` | Grant specific command privileges to a user      |
| `%groupname ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`        | Grant sudo privileges to a group                 |
| `NOPASSWD: ALL`                       | Allow running commands without a password prompt |

By effectively managing `sudo` and adhering to the principle of least privilege, you can enhance the security of your Linux systems, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential damage from compromised accounts.
