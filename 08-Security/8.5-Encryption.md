### Encryption: GPG, SSL/TLS Basics

#### GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)

GPG is a tool for secure communication and data storage. It allows you to encrypt files, sign files, and verify signatures using a system of public and private keys.

##### Key Concepts

- **Public Key**: Shared with others to encrypt data or verify a signature.
- **Private Key**: Kept secret and used to decrypt data or sign files.
- **Key Pair**: A combination of a public key and a private key.

##### Basic Commands

1. **Generate a Key Pair**:

   ```sh
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```

   - Follow the prompts to create your key pair.

2. **List Keys**:

   - **Public Keys**:
     ```sh
     gpg --list-keys
     ```
   - **Private Keys**:
     ```sh
     gpg --list-secret-keys
     ```

3. **Export Public Key**:

   ```sh
   gpg --export -a "your_email@example.com" > public.key
   ```

4. **Import Public Key**:

   ```sh
   gpg --import public.key
   ```

5. **Encrypt a File**:

   ```sh
   gpg --encrypt --recipient "recipient_email@example.com" filename
   ```

6. **Decrypt a File**:

   ```sh
   gpg --decrypt filename.gpg
   ```

7. **Sign a File**:

   ```sh
   gpg --sign filename
   ```

8. **Verify a Signature**:
   ```sh
   gpg --verify filename.gpg
   ```

##### Examples

- **Generate a Key Pair**:

  ```sh
  gpg --full-generate-key
  ```

- **Encrypt a File**:

  ```sh
  gpg --encrypt --recipient "john@example.com" report.txt
  ```

  This creates `report.txt.gpg`, which can only be decrypted by John using his private key.

- **Decrypt a File**:

  ```sh
  gpg --decrypt report.txt.gpg
  ```

  The decrypted content of `report.txt.gpg` will be displayed or saved, depending on additional flags.

- **Sign a File**:

  ```sh
  gpg --sign document.txt
  ```

  This generates a `document.txt.gpg` containing the signed file.

- **Verify a Signature**:
  ```sh
  gpg --verify document.txt.gpg
  ```

#### SSL/TLS Basics

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols used to secure communication over a computer network. They ensure data privacy and integrity by encrypting the data exchanged between a client and a server.

##### Key Concepts

- **Certificates**: Digital documents that verify the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate.
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**: A framework for managing digital certificates and public-key encryption.
- **Handshake**: A process by which the client and server establish a secure connection.

##### TLS Handshake Steps

1. **Client Hello**: The client sends a "hello" message to the server, which includes the client's SSL/TLS version, cipher settings, and a randomly generated number.
2. **Server Hello**: The server responds with its SSL/TLS version, cipher settings, its certificate, and a randomly generated number.
3. **Server Certificate**: The server sends its SSL/TLS certificate to the client for authentication.
4. **Key Exchange**: The client generates a pre-master secret, encrypts it with the server's public key, and sends it to the server.
5. **Session Keys**: Both the client and the server generate session keys from the pre-master secret to encrypt and decrypt data during the session.
6. **Finished**: Both the client and the server send a "finished" message to each other, indicating that the handshake is complete and secure communication can begin.

##### SSL/TLS Configuration

1. **Generate a Private Key**:

   ```sh
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -aes256
   ```

2. **Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)**:

   ```sh
   openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr
   ```

3. **Self-Signed Certificate**:

   ```sh
   openssl req -x509 -key private.key -in request.csr -out certificate.crt -days 365
   ```

4. **View Certificate**:
   ```sh
   openssl x509 -text -noout -in certificate.crt
   ```

##### Examples

- **Generate a Private Key**:

  ```sh
  openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -aes256
  ```

  This command generates a private key encrypted with AES256.

- **Generate a CSR**:

  ```sh
  openssl req -new -key private.key -out request.csr
  ```

  This command creates a CSR that can be sent to a Certificate Authority (CA) for signing.

- **Create a Self-Signed Certificate**:
  ```sh
  openssl req -x509 -key private.key -in request.csr -out certificate.crt -days 365
  ```
  This command creates a self-signed certificate valid for one year.
