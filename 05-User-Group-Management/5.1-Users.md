### User Management in Linux

Managing users is a fundamental task for system administrators in Linux. The `useradd`, `userdel`, and `usermod` commands are used to add, delete, and modify user accounts, respectively.

#### `useradd`

- **Purpose**: Create a new user account.
- **Syntax**: `useradd [options] username`
- **Common Options**:
  - `-m`: Create the user's home directory.
  - `-d`: Specify the user's home directory.
  - `-s`: Specify the user's login shell.
  - `-G`: Add the user to additional groups.
  - `-u`: Specify the user ID (UID).
- **Examples**:
  - Create a new user with a home directory:
    ```
    sudo useradd -m username
    ```
  - Create a new user with a specific home directory and shell:
    ```
    sudo useradd -m -d /home/customuser -s /bin/bash customuser
    ```
  - Create a new user and add to multiple groups:
    ```
    sudo useradd -m -G sudo,docker username
    ```

#### `userdel`

- **Purpose**: Delete a user account.
- **Syntax**: `userdel [options] username`
- **Common Options**:
  - `-r`: Remove the user's home directory and mail spool.
- **Examples**:
  - Delete a user account:
    ```
    sudo userdel username
    ```
  - Delete a user account and remove their home directory:
    ```
    sudo userdel -r username
    ```

#### `usermod`

- **Purpose**: Modify an existing user account.
- **Syntax**: `usermod [options] username`
- **Common Options**:
  - `-d`: Change the user's home directory.
  - `-l`: Change the user's login name.
  - `-s`: Change the user's login shell.
  - `-G`: Change the user's group memberships.
  - `-aG`: Add the user to additional groups without removing them from existing groups.
- **Examples**:
  - Change the user's home directory:
    ```
    sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory username
    ```
  - Change the user's login name:
    ```
    sudo usermod -l newusername oldusername
    ```
  - Change the user's shell:
    ```
    sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh username
    ```
  - Add the user to an additional group:
    ```
    sudo usermod -aG docker username
    ```

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Adding a New User

1. **Create a new user with a home directory and specific shell**:

   ```
   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash newuser
   ```

2. **Verify the user creation**:

   ```
   ls /home/newuser
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   /home/newuser
   ```

3. **Check the user's details**:
   ```
   grep newuser /etc/passwd
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   newuser:x:1001:1001::/home/newuser:/bin/bash
   ```

#### Example 2: Deleting a User

1. **Delete a user but keep their home directory**:

   ```
   sudo userdel username
   ```

2. **Delete a user and their home directory**:
   ```
   sudo userdel -r username
   ```

#### Example 3: Modifying an Existing User

1. **Change the user's home directory**:

   ```
   sudo usermod -d /new/home/dir username
   ```

2. **Change the user's login shell**:

   ```
   sudo usermod -s /bin/zsh username
   ```

3. **Add the user to an additional group**:

   ```
   sudo usermod -aG docker username
   ```

4. **Verify the user's group membership**:
   ```
   groups username
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   username : username docker
   ```

### Summary

- **`useradd`**: Used to create new user accounts with various options to customize the user's environment.
- **`userdel`**: Used to delete user accounts, with an option to also remove their home directory.
- **`usermod`**: Used to modify existing user accounts, including changing home directories, shells, login names, and group memberships.

These commands provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing user accounts in Linux, ensuring that administrators can efficiently control access and user environments on their systems.
