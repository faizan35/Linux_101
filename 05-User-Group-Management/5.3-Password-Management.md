### Password Management in Linux

Password management is crucial for maintaining security in Linux systems. The `passwd` and `chage` commands are used to manage user passwords and control password aging policies.

#### `passwd`

- **Purpose**: Change user passwords and manage password policies.
- **Syntax**: `passwd [options] [username]`
- **Common Options**:
  - `-d`: Delete the user's password, making the account passwordless.
  - `-e`: Expire the user's password immediately, forcing a password change on next login.
  - `-l`: Lock the user's account.
  - `-u`: Unlock the user's account.
  - `-S`: Display account status.
- **Examples**:
  - Change your own password:
    ```
    passwd
    ```
  - Change another user's password (requires root privileges):
    ```
    sudo passwd username
    ```
  - Expire a user's password immediately:
    ```
    sudo passwd -e username
    ```
  - Lock a user's account:
    ```
    sudo passwd -l username
    ```
  - Unlock a user's account:
    ```
    sudo passwd -u username
    ```
  - Display the status of a user's account:
    ```
    sudo passwd -S username
    ```

#### `chage`

- **Purpose**: Change and view user password expiration information.
- **Syntax**: `chage [options] username`
- **Common Options**:
  - `-l`: Display password aging information.
  - `-d`: Set the last password change date.
  - `-E`: Set the account expiration date.
  - `-I`: Set the number of inactive days before the account is locked.
  - `-m`: Set the minimum number of days between password changes.
  - `-M`: Set the maximum number of days between password changes.
  - `-W`: Set the number of days of warning before password expiration.
- **Examples**:
  - View password aging information:
    ```
    sudo chage -l username
    ```
  - Set the last password change date to today:
    ```
    sudo chage -d 0 username
    ```
  - Set the account expiration date to January 1, 2025:
    ```
    sudo chage -E 2025-01-01 username
    ```
  - Set the number of inactive days before the account is locked to 7:
    ```
    sudo chage -I 7 username
    ```
  - Set the minimum number of days between password changes to 1:
    ```
    sudo chage -m 1 username
    ```
  - Set the maximum number of days between password changes to 90:
    ```
    sudo chage -M 90 username
    ```
  - Set the number of days of warning before password expiration to 14:
    ```
    sudo chage -W 14 username
    ```

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Changing a User's Password

1. **Change your own password**:

   ```
   passwd
   ```

2. **Change another user's password**:

   ```
   sudo passwd alice
   ```

3. **Lock a user's account**:

   ```
   sudo passwd -l alice
   ```

4. **Unlock a user's account**:

   ```
   sudo passwd -u alice
   ```

5. **Check the status of a user's account**:
   ```
   sudo passwd -S alice
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   alice L 01/30/2024 0 99999 7 -1 (Password locked.)
   ```

#### Example 2: Managing Password Expiration with `chage`

1. **View password aging information**:

   ```
   sudo chage -l alice
   ```

   Output:

   ```
   Last password change                                    : Jan 01, 2024
   Password expires                                        : Apr 01, 2024
   Password inactive                                       : never
   Account expires                                         : never
   Minimum number of days between password change          : 0
   Maximum number of days between password change          : 90
   Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7
   ```

2. **Force a password change on next login**:

   ```
   sudo chage -d 0 alice
   ```

3. **Set the account to expire on a specific date**:

   ```
   sudo chage -E 2025-01-01 alice
   ```

4. **Set the maximum number of days between password changes**:

   ```
   sudo chage -M 60 alice
   ```

5. **Set the warning period before password expiration**:
   ```
   sudo chage -W 14 alice
   ```

### Summary

- **`passwd`**: Used to change passwords, lock/unlock accounts, and manage password policies.
- **`chage`**: Used to view and configure password expiration and aging policies.

These commands are vital for maintaining user account security, ensuring passwords are changed regularly, and managing account access based on organizational security policies. Proper usage of `passwd` and `chage` helps in enforcing security best practices on Linux systems.
