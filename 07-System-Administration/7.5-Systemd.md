### Managing Services with `systemctl` and Systemd Units

`systemd` is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It provides a suite of tools for managing system services, units, and various other aspects of system initialization and management. `systemctl` is the command-line utility used to interact with `systemd`.

#### Basic `systemctl` Commands

##### Managing Services

- **Start a service**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start <service_name>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start nginx
  ```

- **Stop a service**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop <service_name>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop nginx
  ```

- **Restart a service**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart <service_name>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

- **Reload service configuration without restarting**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl reload <service_name>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```

- **Enable a service to start at boot**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl enable <service_name>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl enable nginx
  ```

- **Disable a service from starting at boot**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl disable <service_name>
  ```

  **Example**:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl disable nginx
  ```

- **Check the status of a service**:
  ```sh
  systemctl status <service_name>
  ```
  **Example**:
  ```sh
  systemctl status nginx
  ```

##### Listing Units and Services

- **List all units**:

  ```sh
  systemctl list-units
  ```

- **List all services**:

  ```sh
  systemctl list-units --type=service
  ```

- **List all active services**:

  ```sh
  systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active
  ```

- **List enabled services**:
  ```sh
  systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
  ```

##### Managing Unit Files

Unit files define the configuration for services and other `systemd` objects. They are typically stored in `/etc/systemd/system` for system-wide services and in `~/.config/systemd/user` for user services.

##### Creating a Service Unit File

1. **Create a unit file**:

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/my_service.service
   ```

2. **Define the service unit file**:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=My Custom Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/my_service_executable
   Restart=always
   User=myuser
   Group=mygroup

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

3. **Reload `systemd` to recognize the new service**:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. **Start the new service**:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start my_service
   ```

5. **Enable the service to start at boot**:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl enable my_service
   ```

6. **Check the status of the service**:
   ```sh
   systemctl status my_service
   ```

##### Example of a Simple Service Unit File

Here is an example of a service unit file for a hypothetical `my_service` application:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Custom Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/my_service
Restart=always
User=myuser
Group=mygroup
Environment=MY_ENV_VAR=value

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Summary of `systemctl` Commands

| Command                                                    | Purpose                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `sudo systemctl start <service_name>`                      | Start a service                                      |
| `sudo systemctl stop <service_name>`                       | Stop a service                                       |
| `sudo systemctl restart <service_name>`                    | Restart a service                                    |
| `sudo systemctl reload <service_name>`                     | Reload service configuration without restarting      |
| `sudo systemctl enable <service_name>`                     | Enable a service to start at boot                    |
| `sudo systemctl disable <service_name>`                    | Disable a service from starting at boot              |
| `systemctl status <service_name>`                          | Check the status of a service                        |
| `systemctl list-units`                                     | List all units                                       |
| `systemctl list-units --type=service`                      | List all services                                    |
| `systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active`       | List all active services                             |
| `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled` | List enabled services                                |
| `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`                             | Reload `systemd` to recognize new/changed unit files |

Using `systemctl` and properly configuring unit files allows for robust and flexible service management on Linux systems. This helps in automating service startups, managing dependencies, and ensuring smooth operation of system services.
